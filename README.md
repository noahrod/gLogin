Problems in paradise with https://www.drupal.org/project/gauth?

Are you searching a module just for login/user creation to your specific Google Apps Domain? (Google Oauth2)

You came to the right place.


**Instalation**

1. Download libraries module ( drush en libraries )
2. Download Google APIs Client Library for PHP in tour libraries directory (sites/all/libraries) 
   git clone https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client.git
3. Enable the gLogin Module
4. Don't forget the configuration of your Client ID, Client Secret and domain (admin/config/services/glogin)
